# slog: secure logging library

This is loosely based on:
[Logcrypt: forward security and public verification for secure audit logs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2005/002.pdf)

It gives the possibility of protecting a text-file such as a log from tampering (except for truncation :/). It should compile on x86/ARM and Arduino-based platforms.
