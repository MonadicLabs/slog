# slog: secure logging library
![SLOG!](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XCt%2B4QrVL._SY355_.jpg)
This is loosely based on:
[Logcrypt: forward security and public verification for secure audit logs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2005/002.pdf)

It gives the possibility of protecting a text-file such as a log from tampering (except for truncation :/). It should compile on x86/ARM and Arduino-based platforms.
